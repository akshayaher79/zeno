Welcome to **Zeno** ‚Äî the blazing fast, plugin-first Markdown blog framework that makes creating beautiful blogs effortless.

Every decision is made with performance in mind ‚Äî from the build process to the generated output.

## Plugin Example

Want to add Google Analytics? Just create a simple plugin:

```javascript
// plugins/analytics.js
export default function analyticsPlugin(options) {
  return {
    name: 'google-analytics',
    onRenderHTML(html) {
      const script = `
        <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${options.trackingId}"></script>
        <script>
          window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
          function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
          gtag('js', new Date());
          gtag('config', '${options.trackingId}');
        </script>
      `;
      return html.replace('</head>', script + '</head>');
    }
  };
}
```

Add it to your config:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    { 
      "name": "analytics", 
      "options": { "trackingId": "GA_TRACKING_ID" } 
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it! Analytics is now added to every page.
